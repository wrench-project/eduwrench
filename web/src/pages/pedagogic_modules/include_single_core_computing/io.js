            <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

            <p>
                A computer typically does not run a program start to finish in a vacuum. Programs often need to
                consume <strong>I</strong>nput and produce <strong>O</strong>utput, which is done by executing <strong>IO
                operations</strong>. A couple of very common IO operations are reading from disk and writing to disk. As the
                disk is much slower than the CPU, even small disk reads or writes can represent a large (from the CPU’s
                perspective) chunk of time during which the CPU is sitting idle.
            </p>

            <p>
                When it comes to IO operations, not all programs are created equal. Some programs will require more IO time than
                others. In fact, programs are typically categorized as IO- or CPU-intensive. If a program spends more time
                performing IO operations than CPU operations, it is said to be <i>IO-intensive</i>. If the situation is
                reversed, the program is said to be <i>CPU-intensive</i>. For instance, a program that reads a large jpeg image
                from disk, reduces the brightness of every pixel (to make the image darker), and writes the modified image to
                disk is IO-intensive on most standard computers (a lot of data to read/write from/to disk, and very quick
                computation on this data – in this case perhaps just a simple subtraction). By contrast, a program that instead
                of reducing the brightness of the image applies an oil painting filter to it will most likely be CPU-intensive
                (applying an oil painting filter entails many, many more computations than a simple subtraction).
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned above, reading from and writing to the disk are slow operations compared to the CPU. Typically,
                there is a difference between read and write speeds as well. Reading is typically significantly faster than
                writing. Furthermore, different kinds of disks have different speeds as well. The table below shows advertised
                read and write speeds for two mass-market SATA disks, a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and a Solid State Drive (SSD), at
                the time this content is being written:

                            The read and write speeds are often referred to as <strong>bandwidths</strong>. The units above is MB/sec
                            (MegaByte per second), which is also written as MBps.

            <p>
                Determining the exact bandwidth that disk reads and writes will experience during program execution is actually
                difficult (due to the complexity of the underlying hardware and software, and due to how the data is stored and
                accessed on the disk). In this module, we will always assume that disk bandwidths are constant.
            </p>

            <h2>A Program with Computation and IO</h2>

            <p>
                Let us consider a program that performs a task in three phases. First, it reads data from disk. Second, it
                performs some computation on that data to create new data. And third, it writes the new data back to disk. This
                could be one of the image processing programs mentioned in the previous section as examples. If this program is
                invoked to process two images, i.e., so that it performs two tasks, then its execution timeline is as depicted
                below:
            </p>

            <IOFigure1 />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example execution timeline.</div>

            <p>
                As can be seen in the figure, at any given time either the CPU is idle (while IO operations are ongoing) or the
                disk is idle (while computation is ongoing). In the above figure, reading an image from disk takes 1 second,
                writing an image to disk takes 1 second, and processing an image takes 2 seconds. (We can thus infer that the
                two images have the same size, and that the disk has identical read and write bandwidths). We can compute the
                CPU Utilization as follows:
            </p>

            <TeX block math="\text{CPU Utilization}  = \frac{T_{Compute}}{T_{Compute} + T_{Idle}} = \frac{4}{4 + 4} = 0.5" />

            <p>
                This means that the CPU is idle for half of the execution of the program. This program is perfectly balanced,
                i.e., it is neither CPU-intensive nor IO-intensive.
            </p>

            <h2>Overlapping computation and IO</h2>

            <p>
                The execution in the previous section can be improved. This is because <strong>the CPU and the disk are two
                different hardware components, and they can work at the same time</strong>. As a result, while the CPU is
                processing the 1st image, the 2nd image could be read from disk! The CPU can then start processing the 2nd image
                right away after it finishes processing the 1st image. The 1st image can be written to disk at the same time.
                This execution is depicted below:
            </p>

            <IOFigure2 />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Example execution timeline with overlap of IO and computation.
            </div>

            <p>
                The total execution time has dropped by 2 seconds <strong>and</strong> the CPU utilization is increased:
            </p>

            <TeX block math="\text{CPU Utilization} = \frac{T_{Compute}}{T_{Compute} + T_{Idle}} = \frac{4}{4 + 2} = 0.66" />

            <p>
                If there were additional, similar images to process, the CPU utilization would continue to drop as it would be
                idle only at the very beginning and at the very end of the execution.
            </p>

            <p>
                The above is an ideal situation because IO time for an image is exactly equal to compute time. More precisely,
                save for the first and last task, <i>while the program computes task <TeX math="i" /> there is enough time to
                write the output of task <TeX math="i-1" /> and to read the input of task <TeX math="i+1" /></i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the above condition does not hold, then there is necessarily CPU idle time. For instance, if the time to read
                an image is instead 2s (for instance because the program reads larger images but writes back down-scaled images)
                and the program must process 3 images, then the execution would be as:
            </p>

            <IOFigure3 />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Example execution timeline with overlap of IO and computation.
            </div>

            <p>
                As expected, the program first reads 2 images, and then alternates write and read operations while CPU
                computation is going on. But in this case, the CPU experiences idle time because images cannot be read from disk
                fast enough. So although overlapping IO and computation almost always reduces program execution time, the
                benefit can vary based on IO and computation volumes (and especially if these volumes vary from task to task!).
            </p>

            <Divider />

            <h2>Practical concerns</h2>

            <p>
                In practice, one can implement a program that overlaps IO and computation. This can be done by using
                non-blocking IO operations and/or threads. These are techniques that are described in
                Operating Systems <a href="/textbooks">textbooks</a>. The overlap may not be completely "free", as
                reading/writing data from disk
                can still require the CPU to perform some computation. Therefore, there can be time-sharing of the CPU between
                the IO operations and the computation, and the computation is slowed down a little bit by the IO operations
                (something we did not show in the figures above). This said, there are ways for IO operations to use almost no
                CPU cycles. One such technique, which relies on specific but commonplace hardware, is called Direct Memory
                Access (DMA). See Operating Systems <a href="/textbooks">textbooks</a> for more details.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another practical concern is RAM pressure. When going from the example execution in Figure 1 to that in Figure
                2, the peak amount of RAM needed by the program is increased because at some point more than one input images
                are held in RAM. Since tasks could have significant memory requirements, RAM constrains can prevent some overlap
                of IO and computation.

            <p>
                So that you can gain hands-on experience with the above concepts, use the simulation app below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, you can create a series of identical tasks that have a certain input and output. Run the simulation
                to see the progression of tasks and host utilization without allowing IO to overlap with computation. Once you
                have observed this, try selecting the checkbox to allow overlap. With IO overlap there should be an improvement
                in execution time and host utilization. You can view this in the output graphs that are generated. You can also
                try varying the input/output and computation amounts to create IO-intensive or CPU-intensive tasks.
                Understanding which tasks will benefit from increased R/W or computation speeds will assist you in answering the
                questions to come.

                                    the end it writes the output of the last two tasks one after the other. The computation on the CPU for a
                                    task is started as soon as its input has been read from disk.

                        task requires 1 second to read data from disk, 2 seconds for computation, and 0.5 seconds to write the output
                        back
                        to the disk.

                        <strong>[A.1.q4.2]</strong> A task requires 50 MB of input data to be loaded from disk before computation and
                        writes 50 MB of data to disk once computation has been completed. The computation performs 500 Gflop. Instances
                        of
                        this task are executed continuously in sequence throughout the day, in a way that overlaps IO and computation.
                        The
                        computer on which this is done has a disk with R/W bandwidth 200 MB/sec and a CPU with compute speed 1.5
                        Tflop/sec. We wish to increase the number of task instances we can execute per day. Should we upgrade the
                        processor? Or should we upgrade the disk? Show your work by computing execution times for both options, possibly
                        depicting executions as in the figures earlier in this page.

                        <strong>[A.1.q4.3]</strong> A task requires 100 MB of input data to be loaded from disk, performs 1 Tflop of
                        computation, and writes some output back to disk. A batch of fifty instances of this task is to be run on a
                        computer with a processor capable of 250 Gflop/sec and a disk with R/W bandwidths of 100 MB/sec. IO and
                        computation are overlapped. How large can the task output be so that the CPU is still 100% utilized? (ignoring
                        the initial input read and final output write, during which the CPU is necessarily idle). Show your work by
                        writing (and solving) a simple inequation.

                <strong>[Programming #1]</strong> Implement a program that first reads in all the bytes in a file into an array
                of bytes in RAM. The program then computes and prints out the number of bytes that are equal to 0. The program
                should also print the time spent reading the file into RAM and the time to compute the result. Determine
                experimentally whether this program is compute- or I/O-intensive. You will need to run the program on a
                sufficiently large file so that you can obtain meaningful results.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>[Programming #2]</strong> Modify your program so that it determines which byte value is the most
                frequent in the file. Is this modified program more or less I/O-intensive? By how much?
