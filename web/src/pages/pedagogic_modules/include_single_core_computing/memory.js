      <h2>Memory</h2>

      <p>
        When a program executes on a computer, it uses some of the computer’s memory (a.k.a., Random Access Memory or
        RAM) to store its “address space”. The address space consists of all the bytes of content that the program needs
        to execute (the “code”, “data”, “stack”, “heap”, “page table”, etc.). You can learn about details of the
        structure of address spaces in Operating Systems <a href="/textbooks">textbooks</a>. In these pedagogic modules,
        we simply consider that a program needs some number of bytes of RAM to execute.
      </p>

      <p>
        When not enough RAM is available (e.g., the program’s address space is too big), the Operating System keeps part
        of the address space on disk and shuffles content between RAM and disk as necessary. Albeit fascinating, this
        comes with a significant performance hit. Our main focus in these pedagogic modules is performance, and
        <strong>we will only consider executing a program if its entire address space fits in RAM</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, consider a single-core computer with 4 GB of RAM. We have three programs A, B, and C, with address
        spaces of 1 GB, 2 GB, and 3 GB, respectively. In this case, we cannot run all three programs at the same time,
        because 6 GB is larger than the available RAM. But we can run program A and C together as they together require
        4 GB of RAM. Note that in practice such a “tight” fit may not work because the entire RAM is not available for
        user processes. For instance, some RAM is used to store the Operating System’s Kernel
          (see Operating Systems <a href="/textbooks">textbooks</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have been paying attention you may wonder why we are even talking about running programs at the same time
        since in the previous tab we said we would almost never do it! We will find out in the Multicore Computing
        module!

      <p>
        <strong>[How much RAM on your computer]</strong> Find out how much RAM you have on your computer in total, and
        how much RAM is available for running new programs on your computer right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>[How much RAM for your browser]</strong> Find out how much RAM your Web browser is using right now on
        your computer (this could be a substantial amount). In these pedagogic modules we often assume that programs use
        a fixed amount of memory that is allocated throughout the program’s execution. But in fact, programs’ memory
        needs typically evolve throughout their execution. To see this in action, in your browser open a few tabs to
        navigate to content-heavy Web sites (e.g., news sites, social media sites). How much more memory does your
        browser use now?
