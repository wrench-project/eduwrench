            <h2>Measures of Work and Compute Speed</h2>

            <p>
                In these pedagogic modules we rarely consider programs that are interactive, i.e., that react based on real-time
                user input via the keyboard or the mouse. A text editor would fall in this category. Instead, we almost always
                consider programs that have some amount of computation, or <strong>work</strong>, to perform and then terminate.
                An example would be a program that mines a cryptocurrency.
            </p>

            <p>
                The simplest model of performance when executing a non-interactive program on a core of a computer is to assume
                that the computer delivers constant <i>compute speed</i>, which is measured by the quantity of work performed
                per time unit. For instance, a program with 100 units of work would run in 50 seconds on a core with a speed of
                2 units of work per second. This last number is called the program’s <strong>execution time</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generalizing the above example, for a given amount of work to perform there is a linear relationship between the
                program’s execution time and the speed of the core on which it is executed:
            </p>

            <TeX math="\text{execution time} = \frac{\text{work}}{\text{compute speed}}." block />

            <p>
                There are many options for choosing an appropriate way to quantify work. One possibility is to use a measure
                that is specific to what the program does. For instance, if the program renders movie frames, a good measure of
                work would be the number of frames to render. One would then want to measure a core’s speed in terms of the
                number of frames that can be rendered per second (assuming all frames require the same amount of computation).
            </p>

            <p>
                Another possibility is to use a more generic measure, for instance, the number of instructions. The work of a
                program would then be measured by its number of instructions (e.g., the number of hardware instructions the
                program performs) and the speed of a core would be in number of instructions per second. This approach is known
                to have problems, as instructions are not all equal, and especially across different families of processors.
                Therefore, a processor that delivers fewer instructions per seconds than another could actually be preferred for
                running some program.
            </p>

            <h2>Flop and Flop/sec</h2>

            <p>
                It turns out that the question of defining a universal unit of work is not possible, but we haver have to pick a
                consistent measure in these pedagogic modules. One option would be Million of Instructions, and thus the
                well-known MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) measure of compute speed. A problem with this metric is that
                instructions (i.e., hardware instructions) are different across microprocessor families, thus leading to
                apples-to-oranges comparisons. Another metric, which is more related to what is being computed is the number of
                floating-point operations, or <strong>Flop</strong>, to perform (making the implicit assumptions that the
                programs we consider mostly perform floating point computations). This is the metric that we use in these
                pedagogic modules, unless specified otherwise. We thus measure the speed of a core in Flop/sec, which is
                commonly used in the field of high-performance scientific computing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like any single measure of work, the Flop count is imperfect (e.g., programs do non-floating-point computations,
                floating-point operations are not all the same). Fortunately, all the concepts we learn in these pedagogic
                modules are agnostic to the way in which we measure work. And so we just pick Flop counts to be consistent
                throughout.
            </p>

            <p>
                Say a program that performs 100 Tflop ("100 TeraFlop") is executed on a core with speed 35 Gflop/sec (“35
                GigaFlop per second”). The program’s execution time would then be:
            </p>

            <TeX
                math="\text{execution time} = \frac{100 \times 10^{12}\text{Flop}}{35 \times 10^{9}\text{Flop/sec}}\ \simeq 2,857.14\text{sec}"
                block />

            <p>
                If a program that performs 12 Gflop runs in 5 seconds on a core, then the speed of this core in Mflop/sec
                (“MegaFlop per second”) is:
            </p>

            <TeX
                math="\text{speed} = \frac{12 \times 10^{9}\text{Flop}}{5\text{sec}} \times \frac{1}{10^{6}}\ = 2,400\text{Mflop/sec} "
                block />
