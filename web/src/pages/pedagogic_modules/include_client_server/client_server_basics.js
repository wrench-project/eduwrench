            <h2>Client-Server Model</h2>

            <p>
                In a client/server model a <strong>client</strong>, that is a program running on some
                computer, wishes to perform some <i>computational task</i>, but does not want
                to or cannot perform it itself (e.g., insufficient hardware resource,
                missing necessary software, missing necessary proprietary
                data/credentials). Another program, the <strong>server</strong>, is running on another
                computer and can perform the task. The client sends the task's input data
                <i>over the network</i> to the server, and the server replies <i>over the network</i>
                with the task's output data.
                Many applications and websites are clients, where they receive
                information from the end user and forward their request to a server for
                actual processing.
            </p>


            <p>
                The performance of a client-server setup thus depends on the network on
                which the data is transferred back and forth, and on the hardware at the
                server. If a task requires a lot of data compared to its computation, then
                the network will be a critical component, otherwise it will be the server
                hardware. Furthermore, if multiple clients use the same server, the
                clients will compete for the server's hardware.
                Finally, there can be more than one server available, in which
                case the client could choose to use the one that would get
                the job done faster.
            </p>

            <h2>An Example: Photo Processing</h2>

            <p>
                On your computer, the "client", you have a <strong>100 MB image</strong> in RAM,
                as part of a machine learning program that you want to use to
                detect particular objects in images (e.g., count the numbers of cars). But
                this program does not implement the fancy algorithm you would like to apply to
                the image, say, because it is proprietary while your program is free
                software. However, you can access remote servers on which the software that
                implements the algorithm is installed so that you can use it
                over the network. This is provided by the company that develops the fancy
                algorithm, as an advertisement of its capabilities. The fancy algorithm
                performs <strong>1000 Gflop</strong> of work on the 100 MB image.
            </p>

            <p>The following picture depicts this setup:</p>

            <ClientServerImage />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example client-server setup with two servers.</div>

            <p>
                The client can use one of two servers: <strong>Server #1</strong>, which you can access via a network link
                with only 10 MB/sec bandwidth, but with a core that computes at speed 100 Gflop/sec; and <strong>Server
                #2</strong>, which you can access via a 100 MB/sec network link, but with a core that only computes at speed 60
                Gflop/sec. The latency for these network links is negligible and can be disregarded because the image is large.
                Also, the output of the algorithm (the number of cars) is only a few bytes, which is negligible. <i>So, from a
                performance perspective, the task's execution consists of two phases: sending the image data over and applying
                the algorithm to it.</i> The image is sent directly from the RAM on the client to the server program which
                receives it and keeps in RAM. <strong>That is, for now, we assume no disk I/O whatsoever.</strong>
            </p>

                Simulating Client-Server Execution
            </Header>

            <p>
                Below is an app that you can use to simulate the
                above client-server setup. Try to simulate the execution with
                each server (use the radio button to select the server to use), leaving
                all values to their default. You should notice a difference in
                execution time. Even though Server #1 has a better CPU, it is connected
                to the client via a low-bandwidth link. Server #2 is thus
                able to finish execution more quickly than Server #1. Then,
                answer the practice questions hereafter, using the simulation app
                to come up with or double-check answers.

                            We can double-check this result in simulation, which gives us an execution time of
                            17.72 seconds. The discrepancy is because the
                            simulation simulates details that our estimate above does not capture.
                            (See the <a href="/pedagogic_modules/networking_fundamentals/">Networking Fundamentals module</a>).

                            enough). The simulation shows execution times of 18.08 secs for Server #1, which is very close
                            to that for Server #2.

                                <li>time 10: image received by Server #1, which starts computing; and start sending image to Server
                                    #2
                                </li>
                                <li>time 11: image received by Server #2, which starts computing</li>

                                <li>time 11: image received by Server #1, which starts computing</li>
                                <li>time 1 + 1000/60 = 17.66: Server #2 finishes computing</li>

                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The second option is 6.66 seconds faster than the first option. As we have already seen, simulation
                            results would be a bit different, but not to the extent that the first option would be faster!</p>

                        <p>This example highlights a pretty well-known rule of thumb: trying to get computers to compute as early
                            as possible is a good idea. In our case, this works out great because Server #2 can get the image really
                            quickly, and is slower than Server #1 for computing. So we achieve much better overlap of communication
                            and computation with the second option than with the first option. This is exactly the same idea as
                            overlapping I/O and computation as see in the <a href="/pedagogic_modules/single_core_computing">I/O tab
                                of the Single Core Computing module</a>.</p>
