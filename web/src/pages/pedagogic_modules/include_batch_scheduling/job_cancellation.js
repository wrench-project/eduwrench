            <h2>The <tt>scancel</tt> command</h2>

            <p>
                You have learned to use the <code>sbatch</code> command to submit jobs. The
                <code>scancel</code> command is used to cancel a job that has previously been
                submitted. It takes a job ID (which was returned by <code>sbatch</code>) as its
                single command-line argument.
            </p>

                    <h2>Simulated scenario</h2>
                    <p>
                        As with the simulated scenario in the previous tab, you can access
                        a simulated terminal on the 32-node cluster's head node by
                        running the following command on your computer in a terminal (a.k.a. command prompt) to start a Docker container:
                    </p>

                    <Segment raised>
                        <code>
                            docker run -p 8808:8808 --rm -it wrenchproject/eduwrench-slurm-terminal ./run_it.sh tab4
                        </code>
                    </Segment>

                    <p> and, in a new browser window, navigate to: <a href="http://localhost:8808"
                                                                      target="_blank">http://localhost:8808</a>. </p>

                    <p>
                        As in the previous tab, again, your home directory in the simulated terminal contains the <code>myprogram</code>
                        program and the <code>batch.slurm</code> batch script.
                    </p>

                        <strong>User competition:</strong> In the previous tab, you were the only user on the cluster.
                        Now, instead, <strong>you are competing with other users!</strong> These other users
                        submit whatever jobs whenever they want, which is out of your control. <b>All these other users,
                        when submitting a job, ask for <i>exactly</i> the time they need</b>. (This won't be the case in real-life, but we're using this simplifying assumption here.)
                    </p>

                        Interact with the simulated terminal to perform the following steps and answer the questions answer the questions (recall that <code>myprogram</code> runs
                        in <TeX math="2 + 20/n " /> hours on <TeX math="n" /> nodes).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>[C.1.q4.1] Job submission and cancellation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Submit a job to run <code>myprogram</code> on <strong>16</strong> nodes with enough requested time.</li>
                        <li>Soon after submission, inspect the state of the batch queue.</li>
                        <li> <b>Question:</b> Is your job pending or running? (your username is <code>slurm_user</code>)</li>

                        <li> Advance time until your job completes</li>
                        <li> <b>Question:</b> What was your job's turn-around time?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>[C.1.q4.2] Sneaky job submission:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Reset the time to zero, to pretend the above never happened.</li>
                        <li> <b>Question:</b> Inspect the state of the queue and answer the following questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li> How many nodes are currently in use by running jobs?</li>
                                <li> How many nodes are currently idle?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li> Your goal is to submit a job to run <code>myprogram</code> successfully asking for as many nodes as
                            possible so that your job can run right away!  Note that it's not because <TeX math="n" /> nodes are idle right now that any job
                            that asks for <TeX math="n" /> nodes will start right away. If the job requests too much
                            time, then starting it right now may postpone previously submitted jobs, which in our
                            cluster is disallowed. So answering this question is not as simple as it seems.</li>
                        <li> To achieve this goal, use the following "algorithm":</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Submit a job asking for 1 node and just enough time to run the program successfully.</li>
                            <li>Check whether the job starts running right away.</li>
                            <li>If yes, then remember that 1 node "works", if not remember that 1 node "does not work".</li>
                            <li>Cancel the job using `scancel`.</li>
                            <li>Repeat, but now asking for 2 nodes, 3 nodes, and so on....</li>
                            <li>Eventually, submit your job using the largest number of nodes that "works".</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> <b>Question:</b> What was the maximum number of nodes that you could use so that your job runs immediately?</li>
                        <li> Advance time until your job completes.</li>
                        <li> <b>Question:</b> Compare and contrast your job's turnaround time with that in the previous question.</li>
                        <li> <b>Question:</b> By looking at the initial state of the batch queue, would it have been possible to use reasoning to determine the largest number of nodes that allows for the job to start right away? If so, how? </li>
                    </ul>

                        Canceling a job is easy, and often a good idea if the job is "stuck" in the batch queue and
                        should be resubmitted with different parameters (requested numbers of node, requested duration).
