        <h2>The <tt>sbatch</tt> command</h2>

        <p>
          The <code>sbatch</code> command is used to
          submit jobs. It takes a single command-line argument, which is the path to a file called
          a <i>batch script</i>. The batch script specifies the job request, and in
          particular the desired number of nodes and duration.
        </p>

        <p>
          When invoked, the <code>sbatch</code> command submits the
          job specified in the batch script to the batch scheduler and prints a job ID after
          being invoked, say <code>job_12</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the job is successful, upon completion a file <code>job_12.out</code> is
          created, which is the standard output produced by the job.
          If the job is not successful, for instance because the job did not request enough
          time, a file <code>job_12.err</code> is created that contains some error message
          (as well as possible standard error produced by the job). Note that with Slurm
          it is possible to customize the name of these two files, but in all that follows
          they are named as above (job ID with a <code>.out</code> and <code>.err</code> suffix).
        </p>

            <h2>Simulated scenario</h2>
            <p>
              You were given an account on a <strong>batch-scheduled cluster with 32 nodes</strong>. You
              have logged in to the cluster's <i>head node</i>, on which you can run Slurm
              commands to use the cluster's nodes. In your working directory on the cluster's head node there is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>An executable called <code>myprogram</code>. This is the program you want to run
                on the cluster. This program can run on one or more nodes, each time
                using all the cores on each node. It has the following parallel
                speedup behavior: <strong>It runs in <TeX math="2 + 20/n" /> hours when
                  executed on <TeX math="n" /> nodes</strong> (typical Amdahl Law behavior). So for instance, running
                <code>myprogram</code> on 5 nodes takes 6 hours.
              </li>
              <li>A batch script, stored in file <code>batch.slurm</code>. This script is to be
                passed to the Slurm <code>sbatch</code> command. It specifies the desired
                number of nodes and duration for running <code>myprogram</code> as a job on the cluster.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              For our purposes, when executed successfully, <code>myprogram</code> simply
              prints some success message on standard output.
              In the real world, <code>myprogram</code> would generate additional meaningful output
              files. Note that in the activity below you will submit multiple jobs to run
              <code>myprogram.</code> In the real world, the program would take in some input files,
              and you would be running these jobs for different input files.
            </p>

            <p>
              Run the following command on your computer in a terminal (a.k.a. command prompt) to run a Docker container (this may take a while):

              The new browser window will present you with a simulated Linux terminal running on the cluster's head
              node. <strong>In this terminal, you can type <code>help</code> to get some information and guidance before
              proceeding to the questions below, and <code>exit</code> to stop the server and exit the terminal
              application.</strong>

            <p>
              Interact with the simulated terminal to perform the following steps and answer the questions (recall that <code>myprogram</code> runs
              in <TeX math="2 + 20/n" /> hours on <TeX math="n" /> nodes).

            <p><strong>[C.1.q2.1] Successful job execution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li> Edit the batch script to specify that you want
                to run <code>myprogram</code> on 4 nodes (use the <code>edit</code> command).
                Specify a duration that is sufficient
                for <code>myprogram</code> to complete successfully.
              </li>
              <li> Submit this job to the batch scheduler and move time forward
                (using the <code>sleep</code> command)
                until after the job should have completed.
              </li>
              <li> Check the content of the generated <code>.out</code> or <code>.err</code> file produced by the job.</li>
              <li> <b>Question:</b> Did the job complete successfully?</li>
              <li> <b>Question:</b> At what time did it complete?</li>
              <li> <b>Question:</b> Did it complete about when you thought it would and why?</li>

              <li> Now Submit a job to run <code>myprogram</code> on 6 nodes <strong>without</strong> enough
                requested time, so that it will certainly fail.
              </li>
              <li> Once enough time has passed, check the content of the
                generated <code>.out</code> or <code>.err</code> file.
              </li>
              <li> <b>Question:</b> Did the job fail?</li>

            <p><strong>
              When submitting a job one must pick a number of nodes and a duration. It is crucial to pick
              a duration that allows the program to run to completion.
