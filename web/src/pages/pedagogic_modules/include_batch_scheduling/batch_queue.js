            <h2>The <tt>squeue</tt> command</h2>

            <p>
                The main goal of a batch scheduler is to place job requests in a <strong>batch queue</strong>, in which they
                wait for available
                resources. This is because resources are <i>space-shared</i>, i.e.,
                no two jobs run can use the same compute node.
                Note that Slurm can be configured not to enforce this requirement,
                but in all that follows we assume that it does
                (which is typical in production systems).
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>The diagram below</b> shows an example scenario, or "batch
                schedule", for a hypothetical 5-node cluster. Two jobs, shown
                in red, are currently running. They both use 2 compute nodes,
                one of them with still 3 hours to go, and the other with still
                4h to go.  Two jobs are "stuck" in the batch queue. The first
                job in the batch queue (which will likely run next) is depicted
                in green. This job has requested 4 nodes and plans to use them
                for 3 hours. Since there is only one node available right now,
                it cannot run and has to wait in the queue. The second job in
                the queue, meaning that it arrived after the green job, is
                depicted in yellow. The green and the yellow job will never be
                able to run at the same time since together they request more
                than 5 compute nodes. <b>If, right now, you were submit a job that
                requests one compute node for less than 4 hours, then this job
                would run right away.</b> Most batch schedulers allow jobs to <i>jump ahead in the queue</i> provided they don't delay jobs that are
                already in the queue. This is called "backfilling".

            <p>
                The term <strong>turnaround time</strong> is used to denote the sum of the
                wait time and of the execution time. For instance, say you submit a job
                that executes for 2 hours, but that spent 10 hours in the batch queue
                before being able to execute. The job's turnaround time is 10 + 2 = 12
                hours. In other words, the turnaround time is the time elapsed between submission
                and completion.

                    <h2>Simulated scenario</h2>
                    <p>
                        As with the simulated scenario in the previous tab, you can access
                        a simulated terminal on the 32-node cluster's head node by
                        running the following command on your computer in a terminal (a.k.a. command prompt) to start a Docker container:
                    </p>

                    <Segment raised>
                        <code>
                            docker run -p 8808:8808 --rm -it wrenchproject/eduwrench-slurm-terminal ./run_it.sh tab3
                        </code>
                    </Segment>

                    <p>and, in a new browser window, navigate to: <a href="http://localhost:8808"
                                                                     target="_blank">http://localhost:8808</a>.</p>

                    <p>
                        As in the previous tab, again, your home directory in the simulated terminal contains the <code>myprogram</code>
                        program and the <code>batch.slurm</code> batch script.
                    </p>

                        Interact with the simulated terminal to perform the following steps and answer the questions answer the questions (recall that <tt>myprogram</tt> runs
                        in <TeX math="2 + 20/n " /> hours on <TeX math="n" /> nodes).

                    <ul>
                        <li> Submit a job to run <code>myprogram</code> on 25 nodes with enough requested time so that it will
                            successfully complete.
                        </li>
                        <li> Use <code>squeue</code> to inspect the state of the batch queue. You should see that your job is running.
                        </li>
                        <li> Soon after, submit another job to run <code>myprogram</code> successfully again (you can modify the
                            same <code>.slurm</code> file, or copy it), but using 10 nodes.
                        </li>
                        <li> Use <code>squeue</code> to inspect the state of the batch queue. You should see that your second job is
                            "stuck" in the queue, waiting for the first job to complete.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>Question:</b> Without advancing time, estimate the following:
