            <h2>Basics</h2>

            <p>
                The term <strong>coordinator-worker</strong><sup>1</sup> makes a reference to a typical
                real-life scenario in which a coordinator (or boss) assigns labor to
                workers. The workers just do the tasks assigned to them without knowing or
                worrying about the larger picture. Only the coordinator focuses on the
                larger picture and tries to achieve some performance goal. For instance, it
                may want to minimize overall execution time (or "makespan"), i.e., the time
                at which the last task finishes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The problem is to design a coordinator that assigns work to workers
                judiciously so at to achieve the intended goal. More precisely, the
                coordinator must decide which task should be sent to which worker and when.
                These are called <strong>scheduling decisions</strong>, and there are many <strong>scheduling
                strategies</strong> that a coordinator could employ. The objective of this module
                is not to teach deep scheduling concepts and algorithms, of which there are
                many, but rather to provide you with an introduction to this complex topic
                and give your a feel for it via hands-on experiments.
            </p>

            <h2>Parallelism through Coordinator-Worker</h2>

            <CoordinatorWorkerNarrative />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Coordinator-worker setup.</div>

            <p>
                Figure 1 above shows the typical view of a coordinator-worker setup. <strong>You will note that this is
                very similar to the client-server setup that we studied in the previous module.</strong> In fact,
                one can view coordinator-worker as an extension of client-server in which the client (the coordinator)
                uses the servers (the workers) to perform many tasks in parallel. You may recall that in the client-server
                module,
                practice question <i>A.3.2.p1.3</i> touched on the notion that the client could have more than
                one task to perform. This was really a coordinator-worker scenario. For simplicity, we
                assume that all data is in RAM (i.e., no disks).
            </p>

            <p>
                Given a set of tasks to perform, <i>whenever there is at least an idle
                worker</i> the coordinator decides which task should be executed next and on
                which idle worker. The input data of the task is sent to the chosen worker,
                which then performs the task's computation. In this module, we consider
                that the client has a set of <strong>independent tasks</strong>, i.e., tasks can be
                completed in any order. In the next module, we consider distributed
                computing with <i>dependent tasks</i>.
            </p>

            <h2>Coordinator-Worker Scheduling Strategies</h2>

            <p>
                You have likely already heard of <i>scheduling</i> in real-world contexts (train schedules, classroom
                schedules). At the most abstract level, scheduling is about assigning work to resources throughout a time
                period. We have briefly encountered the concept of scheduling in the <a
                href="/pedagogic_modules/multi_core_computing">Task Dependencies of the Multicore computing module</a>. You
                may also have encountered the term in Operating Systems <a href="/textbooks"
                                                                           style={{ backgroundColor: "#f7f7f7" }}>textbooks</a>.
                The OS constantly makes
                scheduling decisions regarding which program runs next on which core and for how long.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, we consider the following <strong>scheduling problem</strong>: given a set of tasks, each with some input
                data, and a set of workers, each connected to the coordinator via a separate network link, how should tasks be
                sent to the (idle) workers so that the last task to complete finishes as early as possible?
            </p>

            <p>
                It turns out that there are many possible <strong>scheduling strategies</strong>. The template for
                the scheduling strategy used by our coordinator will be as follows:
            </p>

            <pre>
  while there is a task to execute:{"\n"}
                {"  "}if there is at least one idle worker:{"\n"}
                {"    "}a) choose a task to execute{"\n"}
                {"    "}b) choose an idle worker{"\n"}
                {"    "}c) trigger the execution of the chosen task on the chosen worker{"\n"}
                {"  "}else:{"\n"}
                {"    "}wait for a worker to be idle{"\n"}
      </pre>

            <br></br>
            <p>
                Step a) and b) define the strategy, and it is easy to come up with a bunch of options. Here are "a few":
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>a) Task selection options:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick a random task</li>
                    <li>Pick the task with the highest work (i.e., highest Flop)</li>
                    <li>Pick the task with the lowest work (i.e., lowest Flop)</li>
                    <li>Pick the task with the highest input data size</li>
                    <li>Pick the task with the lowest input data size</li>
                    <li>Pick the task with the highest work/data ratio</li>
                    <li>Pick the task with the lowest work/data ratio</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>b) Worker selection options:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick a random worker</li>
                    <li>Pick the fastest worker (i.e., highest Flop/sec)</li>
                    <li>Pick the best-connected worker (i.e., highest link MB/sec)</li>
                    <li>Pick the worker that can complete the task the earliest (based on a back-of-the-envelope estimate)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The above defines <TeX math="7 \times 4 = 28" /> different scheduling strategies, and we
                could come up with many more! The big question of course is whether any of
                these strategies are good. Intuitively, it would seem that doing random
                task selection and random worker selection would be less effective than,
                e.g., picking the task with the highest work and running it on the worker
                that can complete it the earliest. The only way to know whether this
                intuition holds is to try it out.
            </p>

            <p>
                For Step c) we simply assume that the coordinator can <i>trigger</i> a task execution on an
                idle workers (which will entail sending input, computing, and receiving output) and
                immediately proceed to the next iteration of the while loop.

                                        Say that we have 10 workers that compute at 1 Gflop/sec, each connected to
                                        the coordinator by a 1 GB/sec link, and that we have 10 tasks that each
                                        have 1 GB of input and 1 Gflop of work. Then, each task completes in 2
                                        seconds (a bit more due to network effects that we are overlooking here),
                                        and all tasks run completely in parallel, so that they all complete at the

                                        This is only possible if step c) takes zero (or very little) time in the
                                        strategy, so that the coordinator can trigger task executions
                                        instantly and, importantly, <i>asynchronously</i>. The work
                                        "asynchronous" here means that the coordinator triggers a task execution and can
                                        continue immediately without having to wait for that task to be completed.

                                every other worker, all options will lead to the same schedule. If a task runs on a worker in

                                    The execution completes in <strong>61.50 seconds</strong>. Inspecting the task execution timeline
                                    we find that the coordinator makes the first three scheduling decisions as follows:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Task #5 (2500 Gflop) on worker #3 (150 Gflop/sec)</li>
                                    <li>Task #1 (2000 Gflop) on worker #1 (100 Gflop/sec)</li>
                                    <li>Task #2 (1500 Gflop) on worker #2 (80 Gflop/sec)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>These decisions correspond to the "highest work first / highest speed first" strategy.</p>
                                <p>
                                    When going from "highest work first" to "lowest work first", the execution time becomes <strong>82.00
                                    seconds</strong>, that is 20.50 seconds slower! One intuition for this is that if we run first the
                                    "quick" tasks, then at the end of the execution one can be left waiting for a long task to finish. This
                                    is exactly what is happening here as seen in the task execution timeline. We see that Task #5 starts
                                    last. Due to bad luck, it starts on Worker #1, the only idle host at that time. This is a worker with
                                    low bandwidth and not great speed. Since Task #5 has high data and high work, any scheduled in which it
                                    does not start early is not going to be great.

                                    Using "highest data / best-connected" is the better option here, and going to "lowest data" is worse.
                                    Just like in the previous question, the "lowest xxx" task selection option is a mistake. This makes
                                    sense from a load-balancing perspective. We do not want to be "stuck" with a long task
                                    at the end of the execution.

                                    Here are times obtained with 10 experiments: 56.50, 82.00, 47.67, 50.75, 61.25, 56.00, 64.00, 61.50,

                                    This is a particularly good execution as Task #5 and Task #3 finish almost at the same time. There may
                                    be even better options. You can double-check with the simulation that <strong>none</strong> of the other
                                    strategies come up with this execution.

                                    finds one, but sometimes it is not so lucky and performs rather poorly. One would rather have a strategy
                                    that is never bad, even though it may never find the needles in the haystack.

                                    The trick here is to deal with data, since the "earliest completion" strategy should take
                                    the data transfers into account. The way to construct a counter-example is to look
                                    at two very different workers and to "force" one of the strategies to make a very
                                    wrong decision. Let's consider these two workers:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Worker #2: 20 MB/sec link; 1000 Gflop/sec speed</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Let's use these four tasks:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Task #1: 1000 MB input; 310 Gflop work</li>
                                    <li>Task #2: 300 MB input; 300 Gflop work</li>
                                    <li>Task #3: 10 MB input; 10 Gflop work</li>
                                    <li>Task #4: 10 MB input; 10 Gflop work</li>
                                </ul>

                                    Tasks #1 and #2 will be scheduled first (because they have the highest work). The
                                    "fastest" host selection strategy will put Task #1 on Worker #2 and Task #2
                                    on Worker #1, since it only looks at compute speeds. But this is a poor
                                    decision because Task #1 has the largest input size, and Worker #2 has
                                    low bandwidth. Instead, the "earliest completion" strategy should avoid this
                                    mistake because it accounts for both data and computation.

                                    whenever there is a yet-to-be-executed task and an idle worker). And so, in this simple
                                    scenario, none of them can produce the optimal execution.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is an example in which adding one extra worker (the slow one), hurts overall execution time.
                                    To remedy this situation, we need a much smarter scheduling strategy that would say: "don't assign
                                    work to an idle worker, A, if a faster worker, B, will become idle and then complete that task
                                    before A would". This leads us down the path of a "planning" strategy that comes up
                                    with the schedule ahead of time.
                                </p>

            <h2>Beyond our simple Coordinator-Worker setup</h2>

            <SigninCheck data={[
                <>

                    <p>
                        We have made several assumptions regarding our
                        coordinator-worker setup. Our goal was not to consider all possible
                        setups, but instead to consider a simple one that is sufficient to introduce
                        you to notions of scheduling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, we have assumed that all data is in RAM, so that we do not need to take disk I/O into account.
                        This is still realistic for some setups. For instance, if the coordinator has a fast disk, does efficient
                        pipelining of disk I/O and network communications (see the <a href="/pedagogic_modules/client_server">Pipelining
                        tab of the Client-Server module</a>), and workers keep all data in RAM. But we could have considered a scenario
                        in which both the coordinator and the workers have relatively slow disks and do arbitrary pipelining. In this
                        case it becomes even more difficult to reason about the execution (let's be thankful for having simulation!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have also assumed that each worker is connected to the coordinator via
                        a single, private link. But many other practical situations can occur. For
                        instance, the network could be such that all workers are connected to the
                        coordinator via a single shared network link, in which case data transfers
                        experience contention on that link. In this case, it may not be judicious
                        to trigger task executions on all idle workers as aggressively. Or there
                        could be a two-link network path from the coordinator to each worker, where
                        the first link is shared by all workers, but the second link is dedicated
                        to the worker. This would resemble more closely real-world network setups.
                        Regardless, when moving away from individual private links, reasoning about
                        the execution becomes much more difficult (let's <i>again</i> be thankful for
                        simulation!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, we have only focused on overall execution time as our performance metric. But
                        many other metrics are possible, such as monetary cost (in case each worker charges
                        some hourly rate as in commercial clouds) or energy consumption (as different
                        workers may be more or less power-efficient). Considering different metrics
                        leads to different results for scheduling strategies, and typically suggests
                        new strategies. One can even try to target multiple metrics at once. For instance,
                        one could say "I want to execute the tasks as fast as possible but without exceeding
                        some energy budget".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exploring these more realistic, but often more relevant to practice, setups
                        can take you down fascinating paths that lead to Computer Science research. But
                        for now, how about just answering the questions below?
                    </p>

                        Questions
                    </Header>

                    <p>Say that you have three workers with the following specs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worker #1: 1 GB/sec link; 50 Gflop/sec speed</li>
                        <li>Worker #2: 100 MB/sec link; 100 Gflop/sec speed</li>
                        <li>Worker #3: 100 MB/sec link; 1000 Gflop/sec speed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>On these workers, we need to run the following four tasks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Task #1: 100 MB input; 10 Gflop work</li>
                        <li>Task #2: 100 MB input; 100 Gflop work</li>
                        <li>Task #3: 1 GB input; 500 Gflop work</li>
                        <li>Task #4: 1 GB input; 1500 Gflop work</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>[A.3.3.q1.1]</strong> If the tasks are assigned to workers in the order that
                        both are numbered (Task #1 goes to Worker #1, Task #2 to Worker #2, Task #3
                        to Worker #3, and Task #4 to the first worker that becomes idle). What will
                        the total execution time be? Show your work. In particular, give the
                        completion times of the first 3 tasks, so as to determine the completion
                        time of the fourth task.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>[A.3.3.q1.2]</strong> Could you find one of the above scheduling strategies
                        (i.e., those implemented in the simulation) that improves on the execution
                        time in the previous question? Try to develop an intuition before verifying
                        your answer using the simulation app. Show your work and reasoning. Hint:
                        think of why the schedule in the previous question is inefficient, and of
                        what we could do to make it better (it all has to do with the 4th task).

                    <p>
                        Say you have three identical workers, all with 100 MB/sec links and 100
                        Gflop/sec speed. On these workers you need to run the following workload:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Task #1: 2 GB input; 500 Gflop work</li>
                        <li>Task #2: 2 GB input; 500 Gflop work</li>
                        <li>Task #3: 2 GB input; 500 Gflop work</li>
                        <li>Task #4: 1.6 GB input; 1 Tflop work</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The coordinator software implements the "highest data / best-connected" scheduling strategy.</p>
                    <p>So the simulator input would be:</p>
                    <pre>
                Workers: 100 100, 100 100, 100 100{"\n"}
                        Tasks: 2000 500, 2000 500, 2000 500, 1600 1000{"\n"}
                        Task Scheduling: Highest data{"\n"}
                        Worker Scheduling: Best-connected worker
      </pre>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        <strong>[A.3.3.q1.3]</strong> Estimate the total execution time, showing your work. Then verify your answer
                        in simulation.

                    <p>
                        <strong>[A.3.3.q1.4]</strong> You have the option to upgrade the CPUs to double the
                        compute speed on all of the workers, or to upgrade the connection on one of
                        the workers, doubling its bandwidth. Which of these options is best
                        (assuming the coordinator still uses the "highest data / best-connected"
                        scheduling strategy). Come up with an answer just by reasoning first, showing your work. Then
                        check your answer in simulation.
