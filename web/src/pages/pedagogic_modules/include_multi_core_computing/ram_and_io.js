            <h2>RAM Constraints and Parallelism</h2>

            <p>
                As seen in the <a href="/pedagogic_modules/single_core_computing/">Memory tab of the Single Core Computing
                module</a>, a task may have a sizable amount of data that needs to be loaded and/or generated into RAM so that
                it can execute. Recall from that module that we do not allow a program to use more memory than available in
                physical RAM. Doing so is possible and handled by the Operating Systems (by shuffling data back and forth
                between RAM and disk) but comes with unacceptable performance penalties. So, here again, we never exceed the
                physical memory capacity of a host. If insufficient RAM is available for a task, this task must wait for
                currently running tasks to complete and free up enough RAM. This can cause cores to remain idle. The worst
                possible case would be running a single task that uses the entire RAM, thus leaving all remaining cores idle
                while it executes. Because RAM constraints can cause idle time, they can also cause loss of parallel efficiency.
            </p>

            <Header as="h3" block>
                Simulating RAM Constraints
            </Header>

            <p>
                To gain hands-on experience, use the simulation app below. This app is similar to that in the previous tab, but
                now includes a field for specifying the "Ram Needed For Each Task". So now, we can simulate the fact that tasks
                require RAM space to run. The host we are simulating has 32 GB of RAM available.
            </p>

            <p>
                First try using 4 cores for 8 tasks, where each task uses 8 GB of RAM. As you will see, there is no idle time.
                The number of tasks we can run at a time is 4, given the number of cores and the amount of RAM available.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now try again, but this time set the tasks' RAM requirement to 16 GB. There will now be idle time, as only 2
                cores can be utilized simultaneously due to RAM constraints.
            </p>

                            On the single-core machine the RAM constraint was not a problem as tasks were executed sequentially
                            (there was never a need for more than 8 GB of RAM). With 5 cores, running all tasks concurrently would
                            require 5x8 = 40 GB of RAM, but only 32 GB is available. Therefore, we can only run 4 tasks at the same
                            time. So the last task runs by itself, with 4 cores being idle. The overall execution time is 2 seconds.
                            This is seen easily in simulation.

            <h2>I/O and Parallelism</h2>

            <SigninCheck data={[
                <>

            <p>
                Another common cause of idle time is I/O. While a task running on a core performs I/O, the core is (mostly)
                idle. We learned about this in the <a href="/pedagogic_modules/single_core_computing">I/O tab of the Single
                Core Computing module</a>. In a parallel program this can translate to loss of parallel efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's consider a simple parallel program: 4 tasks that each read in 10 MB of input data and then performs
                400Gflop of computation. The programâ€™s tasks, showing input data files, is depicted below:
            </p>

            <ExampleIODAG />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example 4-task parallel program with I/IO.</div>

            <p>
                For now, let's consider an execution of this program on a 1-core computer with a core that computes at 100
                Gflop/sec and a disk with read bandwidth 10 MB/sec (on which the input data files are located). What is the
                execution time? Based on what we learned about I/O, we should strive to overlap I/O and computation as much as
                possible. For instance, the execution could proceed as follows:
            </p>

            <ExampleIODAG1Core />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Execution on 1 core.</div>

            <p>
                It takes 1 second to read an input file, and then a task computes for 4 seconds. Using overlap of I/O and
                computation, the execution time is thus 17 seconds (only the first file read is not overlapped with
                computation). This is a great utilization of a single core. But what can we gain by running on multiple cores?
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's say now that we have 4 cores. One option is for all 4 tasks to start at the same time, in which case they
                all read their input data at the same time from disk. They split the disk bandwidth evenly, and thus it takes 4
                seconds for each task to read its input. Then each task computes for 4 seconds on its own core. So the program
                runs for 8 second on the 4 cores. This execution is depicted below:
            </p>

            <ExampleIODAG4Cores1 />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Execution on 4 cores, with simultaneous I/O.</div>

            <p>
                executions, so that only one file is read from disk at a time, and so that I/O is overlapped with computation.
                This alternative is depicted below:
            </p>

            <ExampleIODAG4Cores2 />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Execution on 4 cores, with staggered I/O.</div>

            <p>The execution time is still 8s, so the two executions are equivalent.</p>

            <p>
                Overall, we achieve a parallel speedup of 17/8 = 2.125 and a parallel efficiency of only about 53%. And this is
                in spite of having 4 identical tasks and 4 cores, which, without I/O, would be 100% efficient. Increasing the
                parallel efficiency would require, for instance, upgrading to a disk with higher read bandwidth.

                Simulating I/O Operations
            </Header>

            <p>
                The simulation app below allows you to simulation the execution of a two-task program on a two-core computer.
                Each task reads its own input file and writes its own output file. The program is written such that at any given
                time at most one file is being read/written from/to disk at a time (but computation can happen while I/O is
                happening). For instance, if Task #1 starts writing its output file before Task #2, then Task #2 cannot start
                writing its output file until Task #1's output file has been written. In other words, the execution looks like
                Figure 4 above, and not like Figure 3 above.
            </p>

            <p>
                The app allows you to pick the characteristics (input/output file sizes, amount of work) for Task #1, while Task
                #2 has set characteristics. First run the app with the default values for the characteristics of Task #1, which
                is the easiest case where both tasks are identical. In this case, it does not matter which task reads its input
                file first. Make sure you understand the simulation output. Then you can experiment with different Task #1
                characteristics and different orders of task executions, in particular while answering the practice questions
                below.

                            It is better to run Task #1 first. This is because it has a small input size, so it can start executing
                            early, and while it computes the input file for Task #2 can be read. This reasoning holds because both
                            tasks compute for the same time and write the same amount of output. The simulation confirms that
                            running Task #1 first is 0.8 seconds faster than running Task #2 first.

                        A parallel program consists of 2 tasks:

                            increase the work of Task #1. What is the smallest increase that will cause the overall execution time
                            to also increase?

                            In this execution, Task #2 finishes its computation at time 6, while Task #1 finishes writing its output
                            at time 100/100 + 80/100 + 200/100 + 100/100 = 4.8. Consequently, Task #1 could compute for 6 - 4.8 =
                            1.2 seconds longer without impacting the execution of Task #2. This means that the overall execution
                            time would increase when Task #1â€™s work becomes strictly superior to 200 + 120 = 320 Gflop.

                            The simulation gives the following execution times on 2 cores for each option:

                            We now need to determine the sequential execution time for each option. This is similar to what we did

                            module</a> when considering overlap of I/O and computation:

                            <li>Task #1 first: 200/100 + 300/100 + 500/100 + 100/100 = 11.00 seconds</li>
                            <li>Task #2 first: 100/100 + 500/100 + 300/100 + 10/100 = 9.0 seconds</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Hence the parallel efficiencies:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Task #1 first: (11.00 / 9.00) / 2 = 61.1%</li>
                            <li>Task #2 first: (9.00 / 7.10) / 2 = 63.3%</li>

                            The "Task #2 first" option has the highest parallel efficiency, at 63.3%.

                <strong>[A.2.q3.1]</strong> We are using a computer with 32 GB of RAM. What is the parallel efficiency when
                running 2 tasks on 2 cores if they each require 16 GB of RAM? What if each task requires 20 GB of RAM? Show your
                work. You can answer this question purely via reasoning (i.e., no math).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>[A.2.q3.2]</strong> You are given a 2-core computer with 15 GB of RAM. On this computer you need to
                execute 6 tasks. The tasks have different RAM requirements (in GB): 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14. Can you achieve 100%
                parallel efficiency? Show your reasoning. Consider the tasks that can be paired (i.e., run simultaneously) and
                determine whether you can find 3 such pairs.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>[A.2.q3.3]</strong> A program consists of 3 tasks that each takes in 2 GB of input data and have 30,000
                Gflop work. This program is executed on a 2-core computer with 1 Tflop/sec cores and equipped with a disk with
                250 MB/sec read bandwidth. What is the parallel efficiency if the program can never overlap I/O and computation
                (but multiple I/O operations can happen at the same time)? Show your work and reasoning.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>[A.2.q3.4]</strong> Same question as above but now the program always overlaps I/O and computation. Show
                your work and reasoning.
