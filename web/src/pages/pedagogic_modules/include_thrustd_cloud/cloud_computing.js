                <b>Your agency has decided that a low carbon footprint is a high priority</b>. As a result,
                from now on, the local cluster is configured by powering on <b>only 12 of the 8-core nodes, all at the lowest p-state 0</b>.
                Other nodes are simply turned off for the day-to-day business.
            </p>


            <h3>A remote cloud to the rescue</h3>

            <p>
                To still make it possible to run the workflow quickly, your boss has secured access to a <b>remote cloud platform</b>, on
                which your company has <b>16 4-core virtual machines (VMs)</b>, that run on 4 physical hosts in the cloud infrastructure. These VMs are available for running workflow
                tasks and <b>each VM computes at speed 34.4 Gflop/sec</b>. The cloud is accessible via
                the wide-area network, and the data transfer rate is 15 MBps.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cloud has a storage system with read/write bandwidth of 100 MBps, just
                like your local cluster. This storage system can store *intermediate data* during the
                workflow execution. For instance, if a task is executed on the cloud and produces some output
                file, a subsequent task that needs this file, if it runs on the cloud, will access
                the file from cloud storage (which is much faster than remotely accessing the storage on the local
                cluster). In other words, **the cloud storage can "keep around" data to avoid unnecessarily remotely
                using the local cluster's storage if possible**.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good thing about the cloud
                is that it is powered by a green energy source, and thus has very low carbon footprint.

                    <h3>Allocating tasks to resources</h3>


                    <p>
                        Now that you have access to both the 12-node local cluster and the 16-VM cloud,
                        you need to decide which tasks run locally and which tasks run remotely, knowing that
                        workflow data may then have to be communicated on the wide-area. Recall that each task
                        runs on exactly 4 cores, and that we never oversubscribe the cores of the cluster node or
                        on a VM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can now combine the local cluster with the cloud to
                        distribute the tasks of the workflow. That is, you can
                        decide, for each level of the workflow, what fraction of
                        the tasks will be executed on the local cluster and what
                        fraction of the tasks will be executed on the remote cloud.
                        Different resource allocation schemes will lead to
                        different workflow execution times and carbon footprints.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Running Experiments!</h3>

                    <p>
                        The simulation app below allows you to experiment with different resource allocation
                        schemes. <b>Sliders allow you to, for each level, set the fraction of tasks that run on the cloud.</b> You can explore different options yourself, but you
                        should also use the simulation to answer the questions hereafter.

                    <p>
                        <strong>[D.1.q2.1]</strong> The two "extreme" options are to either run all tasks on the local cluster or run all tasks on the remote cloud.
                        Note that the input data to the workflow initially resides on the storage system of the local cluster. Use
                        the simulation to evaluate both these options in terms of workflow execution time.
                    </p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Considering total execution time and carbon footprint, is one option
                            strictly better than the other, and if so which one?</li>
                        <li>If the wide-area link were of infinite bandwidth, how much faster
                            would the cloud-only execution be?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        <strong>[D.1.q2.2]</strong> Most of the computation in the workflow happens in the first two levels. Let's consider the following three options:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Option #1: Run all of Level 1 (the first level) on the cloud, and all other levels on the local cluster;</li>
                            <li>Option #2: Run all of Level 2 on the cloud, and all other levels on the local cluster; or</li>
                            <li>Option #3: Run all of Levels 1 and 2 on the cloud, and all other levels on the local cluster.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Explain why one of these options, and say which one, should be better than the other two.</li>
                        <li>Use the simulation to precisely compare these options.</li>
                        <li>Are any of these options better than the "run everything on the cloud" option?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        <strong>[D.1.q2.3]</strong> So now you're on a mission to determine whether using the local cluster at all is a good idea. After all,
                        its cores are slower than that of the cloud VMs, and the local cluster has only <TeX math="12\times 8=96"/> cores
                        while the cloud VMs have a total of <TeX math="16\times 16 = 256"/> cores.  Let's use the "run all on the cloud" option as a starting point and
                        think of having some portion of those tasks in <strong>one level</strong> running on the local cluster. Say we consider doing this
                        for either Level 1 or Level 2. For which of these two levels do you think this would pay off the most and why?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>[D.1.q2.4]</strong> Say we decide to run some fraction of the tasks in Level 2 on the local cluster.
                    </p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>What fraction of the tasks running on the local cluster is best in terms of performance?</li>
                        <li>How much faster then is the whole execution than the cloud-only execution?</li>
                        <li>What about the carbon footprint?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        <strong>[D.1.q2.5]</strong> Experiment with running tasks in other levels on the cluster.
                    </p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Can you take the execution time even lower?</li>
                        <li>What is the corresponding increase in CO2, if any?</li>
                    </ol>
