            <h2>Link Latency and Bandwidth</h2>

            <p>
                A network is built from <strong>network links</strong> (in the case of wired networks, these links are network
                cables). Each network link has two important characteristics:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Latency:</strong> the time it takes for one bit of data to travel along the length of the link
                    (measured in second)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> the maximum number of bits that can be transferred by the link per time unit
                    (measured in bit/second)
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                A popular analogy is to think of a link as a vertical physical pipe that connects a cistern (on top)
                to a pool (on the bottom) . The latency is the time for one drop of water to travel from the top-end
                of the pipe to the other. The bandwidth is how many liters of water can flow out of the end of the
                pipe per second. In this analogy, the <i>latency</i> is the length of the pipe, and the bandwidth is
                its <i>width</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We assume that links are bidirectional, meaning that data can flow in both directions at the same time (which is
                unlike water in pipes). This model of a network link is not completely accurate as it abstracts away many of the
                details of actual network technologies and protocols. But it is sufficient for our purpose.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Transfer Time</h2>

            <p>
                Given a network link with latency <TeX math="\alpha" /> and bandwidth <TeX math="\beta" />, the time <TeX
                math="T" /> to transfer an amount of data <TeX math="s" /> over the link can be estimated as a first
                approximation as follows:
            </p>

            <TeX math="T = \alpha + \frac{s}{\beta}." block />

            <p>
                For instance, consider a link with latency 100 microseconds and effective bandwidth 120 MB/sec ("120 MegaBytes
                per second"), transferring 100KiB ("100 KibiBytes per second") of data takes time:
            </p>

            <TeX math="T = 100 \times 10^{-6} + \frac{100 \times 2^{10}}{120 \times 10^6} \simeq .000953 \text{sec}" block />

            <p>
                Make sure you know your units and use them in a consistent manner, knowing when units are powers of 10 or powers
                of 2. In these pedagogic modules, we typically use power-of-10 units (e.g., KB rather than KiB).
            </p>

            <p>
                In some cases the first term above (the latency) can dominate (i.e., with small data sizes and/or large
                bandwidths), or can be negligible (i.e., with large data sizes and/or small bandwidths).
            </p>

            <p>
                Here we have used the term, <i>effective bandwidth</i>, to denote the maximum <i>possible</i> data transfer rate
                that a network link is able to achieve. Due to various network overheads, a network link can have a throughput
                of at most about 97% of its advertised physical bandwidth. Thus, if you purchase a 100 GB/sec physical link, you
                will not be able to transfer data at 100 GB/sec. From this point forward, when we describe the bandwidth of a
                network link, we will always mean its <i>effective bandwidth</i>.
            </p>

                <strong>[Latencies]</strong> What do you think the network latency is between major U.S. cities? Go to <a
                href="https://ipnetwork.bgtmo.ip.att.net/pws/network_delay.html" target="_blank">this site</a> and find out the
                current network latency between Houston and Seattle and the current latency between New York and Philadephia.
                Which two U.S. cities (among those on that site) are the furthest apart in terms of network latencies?
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>[Latencies and speed of light]</strong> Assuming that data travels at the speed of light, in a straight
                line, what would be the network latency between New York and Los Angeles? How much bigger is it in reality
                (using the same site as in the previous activity)?

            <p>
                <strong>[Bandwidth]</strong> Download a large file from some Web site and measure the (perceived) bandwidth that

                on <a href="https://speed.hetzner.de/" target="_blank">this site</a>. Note that tools (other than Web
                browsers) are available to download files from URLs that print out download times and/or data transfer rates
