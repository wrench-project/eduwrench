            <h2>Networks are Shared</h2>

            <p>
                Typically, several data transfers occur concurrently (i.e., at the same
                time) on a network, and some of these transfers may be using the same
                network links. For instance, two concurrent transfers could be along two
                routes that share a single link. As a result, a data transfer's performance
                can be impacted by other data transfers. When a data transfer goes slower
                than it would go if alone in the network, it is because of <i>contention</i>
                (i.e., competition) for the bandwidth of at least one network link.
            </p>

            <h2>A Simple Example</h2>

            <p>
                Consider the following topology with the two depicted data transfers
                (symbolized by the red and the green arrow), that
                each were started at exactly the same time and transfer 100 MB of data.
            </p>

            <TopologyContention />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A simple example in which two data transfers contend for
                bandwidth.
            </div>

            <p>
                If the green data transfer was by itself, its bandwidth would be 30 MB/sec.
                If the red data transfer was by itself, its bandwidth would be 40
                MB/sec. But when both transfers happen at the same time, they experience
                contention on the link into host C.
            </p>

            <p>
                Contention on this link means that the two transfers <strong>split the link's
                bandwidth</strong>. If this splitting is fair they both
                receive half of the link's bandwidth, 20 MB/sec. (It turns out that bandwidth sharing
                is a bit complicated in practice as it also depends on latencies, but in
                this case both transfers have the same end-to-end latencies, which leads to
                fair sharing (see a Networking <a href="/textbooks">textbooks</a> for more details if interested).
            </p>

            <p>
                Given the above, both transfers proceed at 20 MB/sec, i.e., half the bandwidth of the link into
                host C, which is their bottleneck link.
                Thus, both transfers complete in time:
            </p>

            <TeX math="T = 200 \text{us} + \frac{100 \text{MB}}{20 \text{MB/sec}} = 5.0002 \text{sec}" block />

            <h2>A slightly more complex example</h2>

            <p>
                Consider now another scenario, with the only difference that the "red" transfer now only transfers 50 MB:
            </p>

            <TopologyContentionSizes />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A slightly more complex example in which one transfer
                operation transfers less data than the other.
            </div>

            <p>In this scenario there are two phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the first phase both transfers proceed with a bandwidth of 20 MB/sec due to contention;</li>
                <li>In the second phase, after the "red" transfer has completed, the "green" transfer proceeds alone with a
                    bandwidth of 30 MB/sec (because its bottleneck link is now the link out of host B!).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Therefore, the "red" transfer completes in:</p>
            <TeX math="T_{red} = 200 \text{us} + \frac{50 \text{MB}}{20 \text{MB/sec}} = 2.5002 \text{sec}" block />

            <p>
                The "green" transfer transfers its first 50 MB of data with a bandwidth of 20 MB/sec and its last 50 MB of data
                with a bandwidth of 30 MB/sec. Therefore, it completes in time:
            </p>
            <TeX math="T_{green} = 200 \text{us} + \frac{50 \text{MB}}{20 \text{MB/sec}} + \frac{50 \text{MB}}{30 \text{MB/sec}} =
      4.1668 \text{sec}" block />

            <p>
                This execution is depicted in
                the figure below, which shows the bandwidth utilization of the network link into host C.
                in the second phase above, part of that link's bandwidth is unused.
            </p>

            <LinkUtilization />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Bandwidth utilization of the link into host C vs. time,
                showing both the red and the green transfers. Because the green transfer is bottlenecked by a 30 MB/sec link, 10
                MB/sec of bandwidth remain unused for the link into host C.

                Simulating Contention
            </Header>

            <p>
                So that you can gain hands-on experience, you can use the simulation Web application below.
                This simulation is for the following scenario in which a number of transfers
                occur concurrently on the same three-link route:
            </p>

            <TopologyContentionSimulation />
            <div className="caption"><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Simulation scenario.</div>

            <p>
                The simulation app allows you to enter a list of file sizes (in MB). Each
                file size corresponds to one data transfer on the three-link route.
                For example, if you enter just number "100" in the text box, the simulation will be for
                a single 100 MB data transfer and produce this output:
            </p>

            <pre>
        ----------------------------------------{"\n"}
                100 MB transfer completed at time 10.5{"\n"}
                ----------------------------------------
      </pre>

            <p>
                Note that the transfer's completion time is a bit higher than what the computations
                we've done so far would give. We would expect the transfer time to be:
            </p>
            <TeX math="T = 30 \text{us} + \frac{100 \text{MB}}{10 \text{MB/sec}} = 10.00003 \text{sec}." block />

            <p>
                This discrepancy is because the simulator captures some details of
                real-world networks (e.g., the TCP slow-start behavior that you may have read about
                in Networking <a href="/textbooks">textbooks</a>) that are
                not captured by the
                above mathematical expression. Such expressions are
                still useful approximations that we can use to reason about data transfer
                times. However, we should not be surprised that they are "a bit off".
            </p>

            <p>
                Entering "100, 100, 50" in the text box will simulate two 100 MB transfers and one 50 MB transfer, producing
                this output:
            </p>

            <pre>
        ----------------------------------------{"\n"}
                100 MB transfer completed at time 26.25{"\n"}
                100 MB transfer completed at time 26.25{"\n"}
                50 MB transfer completed at time 15.75{"\n"}
                ----------------------------------------
      </pre>

            <p>
                As expected, the 50 MB transfer completes first, and the two 100 MB transfers
                complete at the same time.
            </p>

            <p>
                You should use the simulation to explore different scenarios and test your
                computed data transfer time estimates for various combinations of
                concurrent transfers.

                                    The transfer from D to B proceeds at 30 MB/sec as it is bottlenecked
                                    on the link into host B. The transfer from A to C proceeds at 40 MB/sec
                                    as it is bottlenecked on the link into host C. These two transfers share
                                    one network link, but that network link has bandwidth 100 MB/sec, and so
                                    there is no contention on that link. Consequently, the transfer times

                        <strong>[A.3.1.q3.2]</strong> At time 0, a 100 MB transfer starts from host B to host C,
                        and a 200 MB transfer starts from host A to host D. At what time do these transfers finish?
                        Show your work. Hint: Consider the first phase in which both transfers are ongoing, and the second
                        phase in which only one transfer is ongoing.
