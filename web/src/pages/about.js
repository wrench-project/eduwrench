        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Teaching parallel and distributed computing topics in a hands-on manner is challenging, especially at
          introductory, undergraduate levels. Participation challenges arise due to the need to provide students with an
          appropriate compute platform, which is not always possible. Even if a platform is provided to students, not
          all relevant learning objectives can be achieved via hands-on learning on a single platform. In particular, it
          is typically not feasible to provide students with platform configurations representative of emerging and
          future cyberinfrastructure scenarios (e.g., highly distributed, heterogeneous platforms with large
          numbers of high-end compute nodes). To address these challenges, we have developed a set
          of <a href="/modules">pedagogic modules</a> that can be integrated piecemeal into university courses. These
          modules include simulation-driven activities for students to experience relevant application and platform
          scenarios hands-on. These activities are supported by simulators developed using
          the <a href="https://wrench-project.org" target="_blank">WRENCH simulation framework</a>.
