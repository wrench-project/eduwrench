# terms are sorted alphabetically when displayed in the glossary
# each term should be entered in the following format:
# - term: <word>
#   description: <word's description>

# section: what is this about?
- term: workflow
  description: an application comprised of individual computational tasks that
               must execute in some particular sequence to produce a final desired
               output

- term: directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  description: a directed graph containing no cycles, often used to represent a
               workflow

- term: cyber infrastructure
  description: a set of hardware resources (hardware infrastructure) managed by
               software services (software infrastructures) that make it possible
               to execute application workloads, such as workflows

- term: workflow management system (WMS)
  description: a software tool that automatically orchestrates the execution of a workflow
               on a cyber infrastructure

# section: primer on file transfer times
- term: bandwidth
  description: rate of data transfer across a network link, measured in bytes per second

- term: latency
  description: the time it takes for a single packet to travel from one end of a network
               path to the other end

# section: primer on workflow executions
- term: persistent storage
  description: a storage device, such as a hard drive, that retains data even after
               its power source has been shut off

- term: storage service
  description: a software service that manages persistent storage and handles requests for creating, deleting, reading, and writing files

- term: compute service
  description: a software service that manages compute resources and handles requests for executing computational tasks

- term: floating point operation (flop)
  description: a standard unit of "amount of work to do" used for scientific applications (as many of such applications perform mostly floating point arithmetic); computational hardware resources then have speed measured in flop/sec, i.e., how much "work" they can perform per time unit

- term: staging (a file)
  description: the process of storing certain application files (i.e., initial input files) on some persistent storage prior to the application execution

- term: makespan
  description: the overall execution time of an application execution (i.e., the duration of the
            time internal between the beginning of the execution and the completion of the last task).

# section: activity 1 - running your first simulated workflow execution
- term: turnaround-time
  description: a tasks end time minus the time it had been submitted to be run

- term: data locality
  description: the concept of moving computation closer to where data resides as this
                can be more efficient than sending large amounts of data to where a compute resource is available

# section: activity 2 - parallelism
- term: join (Workflow structure)
  description: a workflow structure where multiple tasks "join" into a single task 

- term: cluster compute service
  description: a compute service that manages multiple machines

- term: frontend node
  description: the entrypoint to a cluster compute service that handles job requests from a WMS and dispatches
                those requests to compute nodes in the cluster

- term: compute node
  description: the worker nodes in a cluster compute service that perform work as requested by the frontend node

- term: parallelism
  description: the ability for multi-core architectures to execute multiple instructions in parallel

- term: utilization
  description: the usage of a core while executing a given workload

- term: average core utilization
  description: the average utilization of all cores on a platform while executing a given workload

- term: vertical scaling
  description: augmenting a compute service by upgrading it with a faster processor or one with more cores

- term: horizontal scaling
  description: augmenting a compute service by upgrading it with more machines
# section: activity 3 - the right tool for the job
